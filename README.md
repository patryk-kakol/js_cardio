# js cardio
Various, simple js programs I did as en exercises and for learning purposes.  
E.g.: string manipulations, simple algorithms implementations, FizzBuzz and other  typical classics.  
  
  
Starting with:  
 - js,  
 - eslint ({"extends": "airbnb-base", "rules": {"no-console": 0, "linebreak-style": 0}}),  
 - node (just for running js in terminal, and npm for installing linter),  
 -  vs code,  
 - git and gitHub (my first approach to version control ever)
